<p>

You're going to bring pages of the Internet to your computer screen.
The Internet is a collection of information stored in computers
physically located throughout the world. Much of the information on
the Internet is organized onto pages. You'll bring one page to your
computer screen, discover its contents, and have the option of
bringing more pages of information.
<p>
Some pages on the Internet are cool. I mean really cool. They can be
richly formatted and colorfully illustrated, capable of bringing you
sounds and movies and interactivity. Other pages can be as ugly and
disagreeable as what you'd find under a rock. Your goal: to bring
yourself gratifying pages of information, and no others.
<p>
Content is everything. But to get to the content you seek, you'll need
connections to those pages. Well-crafted pages provide built-in
connections to other pages. That is, clicking your mouse button on a
highlighted word or picture brings another page of information--a
linked page--to your screen. The entire network of pages can be
potentially interlinked, one pointing to another. As a result, you
can bring information in the meaningful context of "Here is some
information on a page in front of me, and highlighted on this page is
a connection to related information I might wish to explore next."
<p>
Netscape's popularity stems from the opulence of its pages and the
ease of bringing them to your screen. Pages designed with expressive
lettering, art, color, photos, sound, animation, forms, and
interactivity can be linked to an untold number of similar pages
distributed on networked computers worldwide. Netscape explores World
Wide Web pages, a part of the Internet rich in multimedia features,
as well as other parts of the Internet that are often text-based. The
Internet's Usenet newsgroups, electronic mail, and alternative
transport protocols offer impressive diversity of content and
communicative prowess. To take advantage of this wealth, Netscape
software contains features to explore the Internet in numerous
domains.
<p>
Foremost, Netscape software presents pages of the Internet with
elegance and efficiency. Netscape software is a browser--an
interface--to pages throughout the world. Netscape software allows
you to immerse yourself in content unencumbered by the complexity of
distributed networks.

<p>

Now, you're probably comfortable with the idea that information on the
Internet is presented on pages you see on the screen. Even the
navigational concepts are pretty easy:
<ul>
<li>You start with a home page.
<li>You click on highlighted words (colored and/or underlined) in a
page to bring another page of related information to your screen.
<li>You click on arrow buttons to go back (or forward) to a page you
have previously seen.
</ul>
<p>
Plus, you can go directly to pages that interest you by choosing menu
items:
<ul>
<li>History items in the <b>Go</b> menu bring pages you have viewed
before.
<li>Bookmarks items in the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu bring pages you
have designated as worthy of easy access.
<li>Directory items in the <b>Directory</b> menu bring pages that help
you use Netscape and Internet features</ul><p> Ideally, the act of
finding pages becomes secondary to what you really care about: the
page's content.
<p>
Like pages of a magazine, you'll want to flip from one screen page to
another, sometimes to continue with the same article and other times
to begin a new article. But you can't hold screen pages in your hands
like you can a magazine. Screen pages are rarely uniform in length
and, displayed one page at a time, don't provide intuitive feedback
on where the information begins and ends.
<p>
So even though Internet pages bring information to you rather
gloriously, there is something distinctly uncomfortable about content
which may continue over numerous links to pages of varying lengths.
Anyone who has witnessed a slide show of a neighbor's family vacation
can identify with the queasy sensation of boundlessness.
<p>
Readers of electronic pages need tools to keep track of pages. The
Netscape text fields, toolbar buttons, and menu items seek to provide
you with the ability to manage pages of information that might
otherwise leave you feeling overwhelmed and unfocused.
<p>
Some pages have the capability to automatically update themselves.
Pages that have server-push and client-pull capabilities contain
instructions that allow multiple interactions with the server
computers. You can always terminate these automatic actions by going
to another page or otherwise exiting the page.
<p>

<hr align="right" width="85%">
<a name="C3"></a></br>
<font size="+3">K</font><font size="+1">nowing that every page has a
unique
</font>
<font size="+3">URL</font>

<p>

To understand how a single page is kept distinct in a world of
electronic pages, you ought to recognize its URL, short for Uniform
Resource Locator. Every page has a unique URL just like every person
has a unique palm print. (Arguments persist as to which is more
cryptic.)
<p>
A URL is text used for identifying and addressing an item in a
computer network. In short, a URL provides location information and
Netscape displays a URL in the location field. Most often you don't
need to know a page's URL because the location information is built
into a highlighted link; Netscape already has the URL available when
you click on highlighted text, press an arrow button, or select a
menu item. But sometimes you won't have an automatic link and instead
have only the text of the URL (perhaps from a friend or a newspaper
article).
<p>
Netscape gives you the opportunity to type in a URL directly into the
location text field (or the URL dialog box produced by the
<b>File/Open Location</b> menu item. Using the URL, Netscape will
bring you the specified page just as if you had clicked on an
automatic link. Notice that the label on the location field says
<b>Netsite</b> for pages from a Netscape server, <b>Location</b> for
pages from a non-Netscape server, or <b>Go to</b> as soon as you edit
the field.
<p>
Here's a sample URL: <b>http://home.netscape.com/index.html</b>
<p>
Netscape uses the URL text to find a particular item, such as a page,
among all the computers connected to the Internet. Within the URL
text are components that specify the protocol, server, and pathname
of an item. Notice that the protocol is followed by a colon
(<b>http:</b>), the server is preceded by two slashes
(<b>//home.netscape.com</b>), and each segment of the pathname (only
one here) is preceded by a single slash (<b>/index.html</b>).
<p>
The first component, the protocol, identifies a manner for
interpreting computer information. Many Internet pages use
<b>HTTP</b> (short for HyperText Transfer Protocol). Other common
protocols you might come across include <b>file</b> (also known as
ftp, short for File Transfer Protocol), <b>news</b> (the protocol
used by Usenet news groups), and <b>gopher</b> (an alternative
transfer protocol).
<p>
The second component, the server, identifies the computer system that
stores the information you seek. Each server on the Internet has a
unique address name whose text refers to the organization maintaining
the server.
<p>
The last component, the pathname, identifies the location of an item
on the server. For example, a pathname might identify a page by
specifying the name of the file comprising the page (such as
<b>/welcome.html</b>) as well as the name of one or more directories
(folders) that store a file (<b>/home</b>).<p>

<hr align="right" width="85%">

<font size="+3">F</font><font size="+1">inding, starting and stopping
links</font>

<p>

A link is a connection from one page to another. You find a link by
looking for one or more words highlighted with color, underlining, or
both in the content area of a page. Images and icons with colored
borders also serve as links. When the mouse cursor points over a
link, the URL location of the link appears in the status field.
<p>
You can bring a linked page to your screen by clicking once on the
highlighted text, image, or icon. Clicking on a link transfers page
content from a server location to your location. After you click on a
link, the Netscape status indicator animates to show you that the
transfer of the page to your computer is in progress. You can stop a
transfer in progress by pressing the <b>Stop</b> button or choosing
the <b>Go/Stop Loading</b> menu item.
<p>
An unfollowed link is a connection to a page that you have not yet
viewed; a followed link is one you have. Unfollowed and followed
links are highlighted in different colors. If you have a black and
white monitor, unfollowed and followed links are highlighted only
with underlining and thus not differentiated. When your cursor points
over a link, the status message text field displays the URL of the
page that one click will bring to screen.
 
<p>
After you click on an unfollowed link, the link becomes a followed
link. If you go back to a page where you have clicked on a link,
you'll see that the link has changed from the unfollowed color to the
followed color. By default, unfollowed links are blue and followed
links are purple. (On Windows and Macintosh, you can change the
colors used to denote unfollowed and followed links from the
<b>Options/Preferences/Colors</b> menu item. On UNIX, you can modify
XDefaults outside of the application.)
<p>
You'll find the ability to stop a transfer in progress is useful if
the transfer is taking too long for your liking. This might happen if
the content of the page is large or if the server computer is
sluggish. Sometimes the page specified by a link  just isn't
available. You'll usually get a message if a connection was not made
or a page not found. Examine the status field and progress bar to
receive feedback about the progress of a transfer.
<p>
When you bring a page to your screen, you'll see the whole page or, if
the content is extensive, only a portion. (Scroll bars let you see
the rest.) Often the portion you see is the beginning of the page,
but sometimes a link brings you content from the page's middle or
end. Nor does a link always bring a new page to screen; rather, a
link can bring a different portion of the same page (in effect,
automatically scrolling for you). For example, the beginning of a
page may include a table of contents that links each chapter title to
the chapter subheading deeper into the page.
<p>
Yet another kind of link doesn't bring a page at all. A <b>mailto</b>
link whose URL begins with <b>mailto:</b>, produces the <b>Send
Mail/Post News</b> dialog box for sending e-mail (with the
recipient's address automatically filled in).
<p>

<hr align="right" width="85%">
<a name="C5"></a></br>
<font size="+3">L</font><font size="+1">inking via buttons and menu
items</font>

<p>

In addition to links in the content area, you can also access links
using Netscape buttons and menu items. Many of the links controlled
by buttons and menu items bring pages you have viewed at least once
before. Button links are particularly useful for going back and forth
among recently viewed pages. Menu item links directly access a wide
range of pages such as a history list of pages you have viewed or a
bookmark list of pages you (or others) have personally selected as
noteworthy.
<p>
Once you have brought a page to screen, you can view (and store, if
you wish) its URL.  Every page is distinguished by its URL. Linking
to a page via highlighted content, toolbar buttons, or menu items is
a shortcut that enables you to bring the page without having to
explicitly request the page's URL. When no built-in link is
available, you can bring a page by entering the URL in the location
field, then pressing the return key. (The label of the location field
changes to <b>Go to</b> when you edit the field.) Alternatively, you
can choose the <b>File/Open Location</b> menu item, enter the URL in
the dialog box, then press the <b>Open</b> button.
<p>
The toolbar offers the following button links:
<ul>
<li><b>Back</b> brings the previous page in the history list. The
history list is a reference to pages you have viewed.
<li><b>Forward</b> brings the next page in the history list.
(Available only after using the <b>Back</b> command or a history menu
item.)
<li><b>Home</b> brings the home page designated in your
preferences.
<li><b>Open</b> produces a dialog box that allows you to bring any
page whose URL you can supply.
</ul>
<p>
Menu items offer each of the links available through toolbar buttons
plus many more. The Netscape application keeps track of pages you
have seen, lets you create easy-access lists of favorite pages, and
points you to pages with current information about Netscape and the
Internet. Choosing a menu item that's the title of a page brings the
page to screen.
<ul>
<li>History items from the <b>Go</b> menu bring previously viewed
pages. The Netscape application automatically appends the title of a
page you have viewed as the topmost menu item in the history list.
The <b>View History</b> menu item produces a dialog box that shows
you how the history lineage is maintained.
<li>Bookmark items from the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu bring pages of your
choice. You can add a bookmark menu item for the page you are viewing
by choosing <b>Bookmarks/Add Bookmark</b>. The <b>View Bookmarks</b>
menu item produces a dialog box that lets you establish lists of
bookmarks for yourself and to share with others.
<li>Items from the <b>Directory</b> and <b>Help</b> menus bring pages
with up-to-date information on Netscape software and Internet
exploration.
<p>
A pop-up menu offers utility features and a shortcut for certain
links. On Windows and UNIX, you can click on the right mouse button
to produce the pop-up menu (on Macintosh, press and hold down the
mouse button). When the mouse button is pressed over a link or image,
pop-up menu items let you go to pages, view individual images, save
files onto your disk, copy locations to the clipboard, and perform
other tasks.
</ul>
<p>

<hr align="right" width="85%">
<a name="C5a"></a></br>
<font size="+3">U</font><font size="+1">sing history and bookmark
lists</font>

<p>

The links offered by history and bookmark menu items merit special
attention because your actions create the links. History items,
automatically inserted in the <b>Go</b> menu, give you access to
recently viewed pages. Bookmark items, inserted in the
<b>Bookmarks</b> menu by selections you make, give you access to any
page at any time.
<p>
History and bookmark items are maintained in lists of page titles. To
bring a page, pull down the menu and choose the title of the page. If
the title of the page does not adequately describe the page, finding
the page you want may be more challenging than you expected.
<p>
Only a single lineage of history items are displayed. For example, if
you choose consecutive links to bring pages whose titles are North
America, United States, Pennsylvania, and Philadelphia, you'll see
all four items appear in the history with Philadelphia topmost in the
list. However, if you next choose a link to the United States page,
you'll see only the two items North American and United States appear
in the history. Only the single most recent lineage from the home
page is maintained. Since Pennsylvania and Philadelphia were pages
extending from an earlier lineage, they have been automatically
removed from the history list.
<p>
Bookmarks items offer a more permanent means of page retrieval. Once
you add a bookmark to your list, the title stays until you remove it
or change lists. The permanence and accessibility of bookmarks make
this tool invaluable for personalizing your Internet access.
<p>
Because bookmarks play such an important role, the Netscape
application offers many options for creating bookmark lists. Basic
options let you add a title as a menu item. More advanced options let
you create hierarchical menus, partial menu displays, multiple
bookmark files for import and export, list descriptions, and list
searches.
<p>
The <b>Bookmark List</b> dialog box produced by choosing the <b>View
Bookmarks</b> menu item provides buttons and fields for managing
bookmark lists. For example, to create a hierarchical menu, you click
in the bookmark list to position the item you'll create, add a header
title with the <b>New Header</b> button, name the header in the
<b>Name</b> field, add a bookmark with the <b>New Bookmark</b>
button, name the new bookmark in the <b>Name</b> field, provide the
URL in the location field, and adjust the indention with the
<b>Up</b> button.
<p>
Don't let the complexity of advanced features dissuade you from the
basic functionality of bookmarks. At its simplest, you can choose the
<b>Bookmarks/Add Bookmarks</b> menu item to add the current page to
your bookmark list, giving you easy and direct access to your
favorite pages.

<p>
<hr align="right" width="85%">

<font size="+3">C</font><font size="+1">hoosing the screen look</font>

<p>

You can tailor the look of the Netscape application by choosing to
show or hide certain graphical elements on the screen. You'll find
the basic alternatives listed as items in the <b>Options</b> menu.
<p>
The default settings show the toolbar, location field, and directory
buttons. These graphical elements provide you with simplified access
to links, commands, and page location information. By hiding any or
all of these graphical elements, you increase the amount of screen
real estate available for page content.
<ul>
<li>Checking the <b>Show Toolbar</b> item displays a row of easily
accessible buttons that substitute for widely used menu items.
<li>Checking the <b>Show Location</b> item displays URL information
that's useful for tracking a page's whereabouts or requesting a new
page.
<li>Checking the <b>Show Directory Buttons</b> item displays
a row of handy buttons that substitute for some <b>Directory</b> and 
<b>Help</b> menu items.
</ul>
<p>
Other items in the <b>Options</b> menu, <b>Show FTP File
Information</b> and <b>Auto Load Images</b> do not display a standard
graphical element, nor increase the size of the content area. These
items properly align information received in FTP format and
automatically include inline graphics, respectively.
<p>
Choosing the <b>Preferences</b> item produces a dialog box containing
a submenu (also known as a pop-up menu or drop-down list). Each
submenu item produces a dialog box containing one or more of the
following panels: <b>Window Styles</b>, <b>Link Styles</b>,
<b>Fonts</b>, <b>Colors</b>, <b>Mail</b>, <b>News</b>, <b>Cache</b>,
<b>Network</b>, <b>Applications</b>, <b>Directories</b>,
<b>Images</b>, <b>Security</b>, <b>Proxies</b>, and <b>Helper
Applications</b>.
<p>
The panels contain settings that determine how the Netscape
application operates. Many settings affect the look of graphical
elements and content.  After you are finished changing any values,
click the <b>OK</b> button to accept the new panel settings or click
the <b>Cancel</b> button to close the dialog box without accepting
changes.
<p>

<hr align="right" width="85%">
<a name="C7"></a></br>
<font size="+3">C</font><font size="+1">hanging styles, fonts, and colors</font>

<p>

To see options affecting styles, fonts, and colors, choose the
<b>Options/Preferences</b> menu item to produce the
<b>Preferences</b> dialog box. The dialog box contains a pull-down
menu whose items let you select which panel settings to view. Below
you'll find a sampling of style, font, and color settings.
<p>
In the <b>Window Styles</b> panel, a set of small, round radio buttons
lets you display the toolbar with <b>Pictures</b>, <b>Text</b>, or
<b>Pictures and Text</b>.
<p>
In the <b>Link Styles</b> panel, a check box lets you specify if
colored links should also be underlined. With a black and white
display, you must check this box to underline links in order for
links to be visible.
<p>
Another set of radio buttons in the <b>Link Styles</b> panel lets you
designate the number of days before the color of a followed link
reverts back to the color of a unfollowed link. For example, if you
specify 7 days, a link that you use to view a page is colored by the
followed link color for 7 days, then changes back to the unfollowed
color. That is, the color indicator for followed a link expires after
7 days. If you choose the <b>Never</b> radio button, followed links
do not revert to the unfollowed color regardless of time. Pressing
the <b>Now</b> button causes all followed links to revert to the
color of unfollowed links immediately. The default value specifies
that followed links expire after 30 days.
<p>
On Windows and Macintosh, a check box in the <b>Colors</b> panel lets
you select colors for unfollowed and followed links. Click on each of
the color selection buttons (on Macintosh, the colored boxes) to
produce a color selector for choosing unfollowed and followed link
colors. If the check box is unchecked, the default color blue
represents unfollowed links and the color purple represents followed
links.
<p>
On Windows and UNIX, the <b>Images</b> panel offers an option for
choosing how to display an image's colors to most closely match the
computer's available colors.
<p>
In the <b>Fonts</b> panel (Windows and Macintosh), a set of pull-down
menus lets you choose the font and font size for each of the two
types of fonts that pages use to display text: <b>Proportional</b>
and <b>Fixed</b>. A proportional font is used for most
text. A fixed font is used for text in editable fields and certain
paragraphs preformatted by the author of a page.
<p>
The display of a proportional and fixed font pair is associated with a
character set encoding from the <b>For the Encoding</b> pull-down
menu. (Netscape allows you to choose encodings in order to accommodate
the character symbols of numerous languages.) You can view or modify
the fonts associated with any encoding by choosing the encoding name
from the menu, then choosing items from the proportional and fixed
font pull-down menus. For example, for the default encoding, Latin1,
you can choose that all proportional font text be displayed in 12
point Times and all fixed font text be displayed in 10 point Courier.
<p>
On UNIX, font size alternatives are offered with radio buttons in the
<b>Windows Styles</b> panel.

<p>
<hr align="right" width="85%">

<font size="+3">S</font><font size="+1">electing a home page</font>

<p>

You can designate your own home page (the page the Netscape
application first brings to the screen each time you open a new
window) by supplying a URL as a preferences panel item. The home page
designated initially with Netscape software (the default) has the
URL: <b>http://home.netscape.com/index.html</b> 
<p>
You can change your home page (and change back to the default, if you
wish) by choosing the <b>Options/Preferences/Window Styles</b> menu
item, clicking the radio button <b>Home Page Location</b>, then
typing in the URL of the page you wish to be your home page.
(Alternatively, you can check the radio button <b>Blank Page</b> if
you want the home page to be empty of content.)
<p>
Each time you ask the Netscape application to open a new window, the
designated home page is brought to screen. The URL can designate a
page from a remote computer or one on your hard disk.
<p>
To get the URL of a page on your hard disk, choose <b>File/Open
File</b>. Then select the page (file) on your hard disk (for example,
you can choose your bookmarks file). After the page opens, you'll see
its URL in the location field. You can select and copy the URL, then
paste it into the <b>Home Page Location</b> text field in your
preferences.
<p>
At first, you probably won't have any pages stored on your hard disk.
But later, you might want quick and sure access to certain pages such
as one with valuable links or one you've created for yourself.
<p>

<hr align="right" width="85%">

<font size="+3">V</font><font size="+1">iewing inline images</font>

<p>

Ideally, pages on the screen should present images (or other
multimedia effects) as simply and efficiently as text. However,
images (and sounds and movies) are relatively larger in byte size
than text and can take considerable time to transport from remote
computers (servers) to your computer. The length of time needed to
bring a page with images depends on several factors, most prominently
the speed of the modem or direct link connecting you with a remote
server. To compensate for the potential lethargy of transmitting
images, Netscape software offers features that let you manipulate how
images are handled.
<p>
The Netscape application loads images into pages automatically. If the
author of a page has designed the page with images among the text
(that is, inline), the images are displayed when you bring the page
to your screen. You have the option, however, of turning off the
automatic loading of images. You can do this by unchecking the
<b>Options/Auto Load Images</b> menu item. When this menu item is
unchecked, the images in pages do not automatically load. Instead,
small icons are placed in the position on the page where an image
would otherwise be.  In addition, the small replacement icon is
sometimes accompanied by alternative text. Also called ALT text,
alternative text is shown only as a substitution when an image is not
loaded.
<p>
You can then decide to view these images at a later time. To manually
load all images that are represented by icons, you can press the
<b>Images</b> button in the toolbar or select the <b>View/Load
Images</b> menu item. To manually load an individual image, click on
the image's icon.
<p>
The advantage of unchecking <b>Auto Load Images</b> is that pages are
brought to screen faster. The disadvantage is that you can't view the
images until you specify that you want the images loaded.
<p>
The <b>Auto Load Images</b> item affects subsequent links and not the
current contents of a page. However, if you choose the
<b>View/Reload</b> menu item or press the <b>Reload</b> button on the
toolbar, you bring the current page back again, this time with the
<b>Auto Load Image</b> option active.
<p>
You also have the option of displaying an image incrementally as the
image is transmitted or in a single burst after the transmission.
Typically, the <b>While Loading</b> option provides more satisfying
feedback. However, on a fast network, the <b>After Loading</b> option
may complete the load slightly faster.
<p>
To set this option, choose the <b>Options/Preferences/Images</b> menu
item, then select one of the two radio buttons: <b>While Loading</b>
or <b>After Loading</b>.
<p>
Like highlighted text, an inline image may be linked to another page,
another position on the same page, or any type of external file such
as an external image. As with all links, pointing the mouse button
over a link puts in the URL location of the prospective link in the
status field.
<p>

<hr align="right" width="85%">
<a name="C10"></a></br>
<font size="+3">V</font><font size="+1">iewing external images</font>

<p>

External images (unlike inline images) are displayed in their own
windows. You can view an external image by clicking on a link to the
image. The Netscape application can open external images stored in
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format), JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts
Group), and XBM (X Bit Map) file formats. Other file formats require
that you have a suitable helper application available on your hard
disk (and referenced in the <b>Preferences</b> dialog box of the
<b>Options</b> menu).
<p>
Links to external images work like links to pages. An external image
file has a unique URL just like an ordinary page. External images are
not automatically loaded in their full representation even if the
<b>Auto Load Images</b> item is checked.
<p>
You can click on highlighted text, an image icon, or an inline image
to bring an external image into a separate window on the screen.
Netscape or the external application opens and presents the image in
a separate window. You must click back into the Netscape window to
continue working with the Netscape application.
<p>
Pages that wish to present large or detailed images often have inline
snapshot images (also called thumbnail images) inserted into pages
that serve as links to external images. Unlike the icon replacements,
these snapshots provide an approximate view of the actual image, yet
are still much smaller and faster to transport than the full image.
You can expand the snapshot into the full image by clicking once on
the snapshot.

can contain forms for you to enter and send information. For example,
a page might have a form with fields for you to enter a name and
address next to a button that sends the information to the page's
author. Forms may offer editable fields with or without default text,
check boxes, radio buttons, pull-down menus, selection lists, and
buttons to send or clear the information you enter. The content you
enter into a form doesn't permanently alter the page (that is, you're
not modifying the source page at its location), yet the form gives
you the ability to conveniently transmit a response.
<p>
To send ordinary e-mail, you fill in fields to supply the content of
your message, the subject summary, and the e-mail address of the
intended recipient. Pages with forms let you reply to information you
read in the page. To send a form, you fill in one or more fields
embedded within a page, usually labeled with instructions and
configured with a button that sends the form's contents to the
recipient without requiring you to provide any e-mail address.
<p>
The author of a page determines the layout of a form. A page may
contain multiple forms, each form capable of sending fields
independently of another form on the page. Fields in a form may
restrict the kind or range of text you enter (such as numbers only)
to help you fill in the form as desired.
<p>
Typically, forms are used to give you a fast and easy way to make a
request or send back a response regarding the page you are reading.
Forms can supply an interface to databases with fields that let you
query for information and perform Internet searches. The Usenet news
pages, designed for people to communicate with each other on special
interests, contain forms for you to enter articles and subscribe to
newsgroups. The Netscape software has built-in links to pages with
forms for you to comment about the Netscape application, and request
product information.

<p>

Netscape software allows computers to transfer information in a secure
way that prevents the forms you send or the pages you receive from
being misappropriated. The graphical elements and dialog boxes that
reflect Netscape's security interface are described in the reference
section on <b>graphical elements</b>.
<p>
Security issues arise because information travelling on the Internet
usually take a circuitous route through several intermediary
computers to reach any destination computer. The actual route your
information takes to reach its destination is not under your control.
<p>
As your information travels on Internet computers, any intermediary
computer has the potential to eavesdrop and make copies. An
intermediary computer could even deceive you and exchange information
with you by misrepresenting itself as your intended destination.
These possibilities make the transfer of confidential information
such as passwords or credit card numbers susceptible to abuse.
<p>
The Netscape application and Netscape server use patented RSA public
key cryptographic technology and custom software to allow you to send
and receive information securely. (The security protocols are open
and are expected to be implemented by other client and server
vendors.) Only your computer and the server can encrypt and decrypt
your information. In transit, the information is an unreadable
jumble. An intermediary can continue to route the data, and even make
copies of it, but the information cannot be decrypted and remains
private and safely communicated.
<p>
As part of the cryptographic technology, the Netscape application and
Netscape server are able to authenticate Internet servers. This
prevents an intermediary computer from posing as your destination.
<p>
Not all exchanges of information are secure. Netscape uses graphical
elements and dialog boxes to inform you when you are interacting with
secure and insecure server sites.
<ul>
<li>A URL that begins with <b>https://</b> (instead of<b>http://</b>)
indicates that a document comes from a secure server. Similarly, a
news URL that begins with <b>snews:</b> (instead of <b>news:</b>)
indicates that a document comes from a secure news server. To access
news servers other than the default news server, use two slashes
(<b>//</b>) after the colon (<b>:</b>).

<li>To the left of the status message, a doorkey icon on a blue
background indicates a secure document (a document is a slightly
broader term for a page and its contents); a document with a broken
doorkey icon on a gray background indicates an insecure document.

<li>Above the content area, a blue colorbar indicates a secure
document; a gray colorbar indicates an insecure document.

<li>Several dialog boxes, whose appearance can be set as a preference
item, alert you to changes in security status
among the documents you bring to screen.
</ul>
You can examine the security qualifications of a document in more
detail by choosing the <b>File/Document Information</b> menu item.
The resulting dialog box tells you about encryption grade and server
certification.

<font size="+3">U</font><font size="+1">nderstanding public key
technology</font>

<p>

The public key technology working within the Netscape application and
Netscape server is often described with unfamiliar security
terminology. You might find the explanation of how public keys works
an interesting supplement to your knowledge of Internet security.
<p>
Keys are files. You don't open a key (file) like you open a document
or a word processor application. Keys are more like magnetic badges
with powerful encryption and decryption capabilities.
<p>
There are two kinds of keys and you need both kinds. One is a private
key. It sits on your computer and you never give it out. The other is
a public key. You can make as many copies of it as you wish and give
it out to everybody.
<p>
You need both kinds of keys (private and public) because they are
fundamentally linked. (Like a pair of pants, you always buy both
legs.) You can pass your public key around to whomever you wish, but
in order for any key to perform its decryption duty, it must be
matched back to its linked key-file partner.
<p>
Both public and private keys have the ability encrypt and (as a set)
decrypt information. Keys work in two primary ways:
<ol>
<li>Others can encrypt information with your public key (the key
you've distributed freely) and send the information securely to you.
Only you, with your private key, can decrypt their message. The
sender can be sure that the message is read only by you (encrypted
for privacy) and has not been altered.
<li>You can encrypt information with your private key and send the
information securely over the network. Anyone on the network who has
your public key (the key you've distributed freely) can decrypt your
message. The recipient can be sure that the message came only from
you (authenticated with your digital signature) and has not be
altered.
</ol>
In summary, your public and private key (files) are linked by a
powerful cryptographic algorithm that would require major computer
resources to crack. No one else's keys can decipher messages to you
encrypted with your public key. And no one else's keys can be used to
pose as you by sending messages encrypted with your private key.

<font size="+3">A</font><font size="+1">ccessing servers for news and
e-mail</font>

<p>

Do you know the name of your news server and e-mail server? If not,
you will have to find out from your service provider, systems
administrator, or resident know-it-all. By specifying the names of
these servers as preference items, Netscape software can provide you
with newsreader features and the ability to send e-mail.
<p>
World Wide Web pages provide one means of obtaining information on the
Internet. Two other popular Internet information services are Usenet
newsgroups and electronic mail (e-mail). The Netscape application
lets you fully interact with Usenet newsgroups. You can also send
e-mail with the text of a page included. Upcoming pages describe
these services in more detail.
<p>
Before you can access any newsgroup news or send any e-mail, you need
to tell the Netscape application how to make the appropriate
connection to the server computer handling each task. Whereas World
Wide Web pages are distributed by servers familiar with World Wide
Web protocols, Usenet newsgroups and e-mail use their own protocols.
<p>
Newsgroup news is distributed by a news server. To specify the name of
your news server, choose the <b>Options/Preferences/News</b> menu
item, then type in the name of the news server in the <b>News (NNTP)
Server</b> field. You should specify a local news server, if
available.
<p>
Similar to the way newsgroup news is distributed by a news server,
e-mail is distributed by a SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol)
server.  To specify the name of your SMTP server, choose the
<b>Options/Preferences/Mail</b> menu item, then type in the name of
the SMTP server in the <b>Mail (SMTP) Server</b> field. You should
specify a local mail server, if available.

<p>

Netscape software lets you receive and send newsgroup postings. A
posting is a article of writing (news, for short) made available for
others on the Internet to read. As you view a posting, Netscape
provides a row of buttons in the content area to allow you to track,
reply to, or initiate postings.
<p>
People post articles (send their news) to newsgroups. Newsgroups are
organized by subject; each newsgroup has a name intended to reflect
the topic of discussion for its postings. The Usenet is the
collection of all newsgroups; it is the Internet's multifaceted
bulletin board especially designed for people to communicate news
with one another on special interest topics.
<p>
You can access a Usenet newsgroup posting in much the same way as you
access an ordinary page. Clicking on a link to a Usenet newsgroup
brings you the newsgroup list, a directory that lists the titles of
postings. Postings are highlighted like other Netscape links.
Clicking on a link to an individual posting, either in a newsgroup
list page or an ordinary page, brings you the posting. Netscape also
gives you the opportunity to bring a newsgroup list and any of its
postings to your screen by choosing the <b>File/Open Location</b>
menu item and entering the URL of the newsgroup or newsgroup posting.
<p>
The locations of Usenet news are formatted similarly, but not
identically, to other pages. For example, the URL
<b>news:alt.tv.northern-exp</b> specifies the server protocol
<b>news:</b> and the newsgroup <b>alt.tv.northern-exp</b>. Unlike
other Internet connections, the URL does not specify a server name
and pathname with preceding slashes.
<p>
Each newsgroup has a unique name, described with words separated by
periods. Some words (like <b>alt</b>, short for alternative) specify
categories rather than a particular newsgroup. You can use the
asterisk character (<b>*</b>) as a wildcard to find out the names of
individual newsgroups among the many types of newsgroups. For
example, the URL <b>news:alt.*</b> brings you a list of all the
newsgroups in the category <b>alt</b>. The URL <b>news:alt.tv*</b>
brings you a narrower list of newsgroups in the category of
<b>alt.tv</b>. Other examples of URLs that list categories of
newsgroups include <b>news:comp.*</b> (computers), <b>news:rec.*</b>
(recreation), <b>news:sci.*</b> (science), and <b>news:talk.*</b>
(analysis). Note that not all news servers provide access to all
newsgroups. There are thousands of newsgroups.
<p>
Reading Usenet news can be as easy as reading any other Internet page:
Click on a link and bring a Usenet news article to your screen. But
newsgroup pages offer advantages (notably the ability to easily
publish your own writing to other newsgroup readers) and
disadvantages (no images, weak formatting, and limited links).
Newsgroup pages are presented with two rows of buttons (one row at
the top of each page and an identical set at the bottom of each page)
to give you access to the special features of newsgroups.
<p>


<hr align="right" width="85%">
<a name="C12a"></a></br>
<font size="+3">M</font><font size="+1">astering </font>
<font size="+3">U</font><font size="+1">senet news</font>

<p>

Each newsgroup presents its articles along threads. A thread bundles
an article with a response to the article. The grouping of a new
topic with one or more responses to the topic (taking the form of an
indented outline) gives the reader a context to share with the
articles' authors. A strictly chronological organization of every
newsgroup contribution would create a discombobulated trail of
articles less pleasant than reading Joyce in his later years.
<p>
The outline form of a newsgroup listing page shows how a new topic has
each response indented one level in from the original posting. A
response to a response is indented another level deep, and so on. The
row of buttons on each newsgroup page give you controls for reading
and writing along newsgroup threads. A button selection also allows
you to subscribe to and unsubscribe from newsgroup postings. When you
subscribe to a newsgroup, the name of the newsgroup is added to a
list (a News RC file) maintained by the Netscape software. Choosing
the <b>Directory/Go To Newsgroups</b> menu item or pressing the
<b>Subscribed Newsgroups</b> button from any newsgroup page displays
the current list of subscribed newsgroups as links on a page.
<p>
The buttons on a newsgroup page vary depending on whether you are
viewing a page of newsgroup listings or a newsgroup article.
<ul>
<li>A page that lists articles has buttons to post a new article, mark
all articles as read, show all articles or only new articles,
subscribe to the newsgroup, and go to the list of subscribed
newsgroups.
<li>A page that contains an article has buttons to navigate within or
among threads, mark a thread as read, go to the list of articles, go
to the list of subscribed newsgroups, post a response to an article,
and post a response while also replying via e-mail to an article's
author. To replay via e-mail to an article's author without posting,
click on the author's name (the name is a link to the <b>Send
Mail/Post News</b> dialog).
</ul>
<p>

<font size="+3">S</font><font size="+1">ending e-mail</font>

<p>

The Netscape application lets you create and send outgoing e-mail.
(Currently, Netscape has no facility for receiving incoming e-mail so
you'll need a dedicated mail application to read e-mail sent to you.)
With the press of a button, you can insert the text of the current
page in the e-mail message you create. You can also send an
attachment (a file containing the text of a page, the HTML source
code of a page, or a separate file of your choosing).
<p>
To send e-mail, choose the <b>File/Mail Document</b> menu item. This
produces the <b>Send Mail/Post News</b> dialog box. You may discover
pages with a link or button that also produce the <b>Send Mail/Post
News</b> dialog box. Likewise, newsgroup pages with a button for
posting articles use this same facility.

The dialog box has several text fields:
<ul>
<li>The <b>From</b> field contains your e-mail address (supplied in
the <b>Mail</b> panel).
<li>The <b>Mail To</b> field takes the e-mail address of the intended
mail recipient.
<li>The <b>Post To (Newsgroup)</b> field takes the name of the
newsgroup you wish to post to, preset with the name of the current
newsgroup (if any).
<li>The <b>Subject</b> field offers a place to include a short
description of the e-mail, usually preset with the name of the
current page.
<li>The <b>Attachment</b> field contains the name of any file you have
attached.
<li>The large message field offers a place to type a message and
include the text of the current page, preset for mail with the
current page's URL.
</ul>
<p>
You need to know the Internet mail address of where you want your
e-mail to go. Internet addresses typically contain a user name
followed by the @ symbol (pronounced "at"), followed by mail server
location name. For example, to send e-mail to this company, enter:
<b>info@netscape.com</b>
<p>
Pressing the <b>Quote Document</b> button inserts the text of the
current page inside the message field. Each line of included text
appears in the message field preceded by the greater than symbol
(<b>&gt;</b>). The Netscape application automatically inserts the
<b>&gt;</b> symbol to differentiate the page's text from your
message.
<p>
Pressing the Attach button produces a dialog box that lets you send
e-mail with a file attachment. An attachment is a separate document
sent along with the e-mail message. The dialog box offers the choice
of <b>Document Text</b>, <b>Document Source</b>, or <b>File</b> radio
buttons (with a <b>Browse</b> button to select a file).
<p>
If you want to send the current page as an attachment (this may be
helpful if your recipient is going to reuse the document), choosing
the <b>Document Text</b> item sends the text of the message intact
(no &gt; symbols are appended to each line) while choosing the
<b>Document Source</b> item sends the text of the message embedded
with all the HTML instructions that format Internet pages. The
<b>File</b> item lets you select a local file.
<p>
Pressing the <b>Send</b> button transmits the message and any
attachments to the recipient. If you've specified a text file
containing your signature in the <b>Mail</b> panel, your signature is
appended to the message field in all of your mailings.

<p>

Netscape software gives you the opportunity to save a page as a file
on your computer. You can do this after or instead of bringing the
page to your screen.
<p>
The <b>File/Save As</b> menu item produces a dialog box that lets you
save the current page as a source (HTML) file or a text file on your
disk. (On UNIX, you can also save in PostScript format.) A file saved
in HTML source format retains the formatting of the original page. A
file saved in text format is presented as plain text. You can save an
image file, but not a page's inline images.
<p>
You can save a page as a disk file instead of bringing the page to
screen by using a pop-up menu item. While pointing over a link, click
on the right mouse button (on Macintosh, hold down the mouse button)
to pop up the menu. The <b>Save this Link as</b> item saves to disk
(instead of bringing to screen) the page whose link you are clicking
on. The <b>Save this Image as</b> item saves to disk (instead of
bringing to screen) the image whose link you are clicking on.
<p>
Saving to disk is particularly useful for retrieving a nonformatted
page (such as a data file) not intended for viewing. You can also
produce the dialog box for saving a page to disk by clicking on a
link with the shift key held down (option key on Macintosh). Other
pop-up menu items let you copy page and image locations (URLs) to the
clipboard.
<p>
Saving to disk is also offered as a pop-up menu item. While pointing
over a link, click on the rightmost mouse button (on Macintosh, hold
down the mouse button) to pop up the menu. The <b>Save this Link
as</b> item saves to disk (instead of bringing to screen) the page
whose link you are clicking on. The <b>Save this Image as</b> item
saves to disk (instead of bringing to screen) the image whose link
you are clicking on. Other pop-up menu items let you copy page and
image locations (URLs) to the clipboard.
<p>
After a file is saved to disk, you can use the <b>File/Open File</b>
menu item to display the local file as a Netscape page. (A file on
your disk is a local file; a file out on the network is a remote
file.) For GIF, JPEG, or other nontext files to appear as available
files in the <b>Open File</b> dialog, make sure to select "All Files"
as the file type (on Macintosh, hold down the option key while
selecting the <b>Open File</b> menu item).
<p>
The <b>View/Source</b> menu item lets you view the current page in its
HTML format. On Windows, the text is displayed in a dialog box. On
Macintosh, the text is stored in a temporary file and displayed using
the Macintosh's generic text application capable of saving the file
(if no text application is available, a dialog asks you to save or
delete the text file). On UNIX, the text is displayed in a dialog box
that offers a <b>Save</b> button.
<p>
The <b>File/Mail Document</b> menu item produces a dialog box that
lets you send the current page as an e-mail attachment.
<p>
The <b>Bookmarks/View Bookmarks</b> menu item produces a dialog box
that offers an <b>Export</b> button. This button does not save
pages, but lets you save page links in a file.
<p>
Note: Netscape software works on several computer platforms and
reserves the use of a few special characters to help interpret URLs.
To avoid problems, you should not use the following characters as
part of a file name:
<ul>
<li>slash (/)
<li>colon (:)
<li>number symbol (#)
</ul>

<p>
Many of the <b>File</b> and <b>Edit</b> menu items in the Netscape
application work as they do on other applications. You can copy from
and print the content area of pages, though you might need to adjust
the size of the Netscape window to have a page print in the way you
wish.
<p>
To open a new Netscape window, choose the <b>File/New Window</b> menu
item. The new window brings another copy of your home page to screen
in a fully functional and independent Netscape window. You can have
simultaneous network connections.
<p>
To print the contents of the current page, choose the
<b>File/Print</b> menu item or press the <b>Print</b> button in the
toolbar. A <b>Print</b> dialog box lets you select printing options
and begin printing. On Windows, you can choose <b>File/Print
Preview</b> to see a screen display of a printed page.
<p>
The Netscape application reformats a document to the printed paper
size when printing a page. The print command rearranges the content
area (text is word-wrapped and graphics are repositioned) in order to
accommodate paper size.
<p>
To set up the page for printing on Windows, choose the <b>Print
Setup</b> button from the <b>Print</b> dialog box. On the
Macintosh, choose the <b>File/Page Setup</b> menu item. You
can use this command to choose landscape printing (across the long
side of paper) instead of the more common portrait orientation.
<p>
To cut, copy, and paste, choose the respective items from the
<b>Edit</b> menu. Note that <b>Cut</b> and <b>Paste</b> items are
only effective in certain editable fields. The content area is a
read-only field that only enables you to select and copy text for use
elsewhere.
<p>
To find a word or phrase within a page, choose the <bedit find< b>
menu item or press the <b>Find</b> button in the toolbar. A
<b>Find</b> dialog box lets you enter the string of characters that
you wish to find. Check the <b>Match Case</b> radio button (<b>Case
Sensitive</b> on the Macintosh and UNIX) to require capital letters
to match. Check the <b>Up</b> or <b>Down</b> radio button (<b>Find
Backwards</b> on Macintosh and UNIX) to direct the search from the
insertion bar toward the beginning or end of the document. A search
that reaches one end of the document produces a dialog box asking
whether you wish to continue the search from the opposite end.
<p>
To find the same word or phrase again, choose <b>Edit/Find Again</b>.
