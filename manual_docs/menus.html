<ul>
<li><b>New Window</b>
<br>		Creates a new window and brings the default Netscape home
page into
the content area.

<li><b>Open Location...</b>
<br>		Produces a dialog box that lets you enter a Uniform
Resource
Locator (URL) to bring the specified page into the content area. Every
page has
a unique URL that identifies its protocol, server, and file pathname.

<img src="images/openurl.gif">

<li><b>Open File...</b>
<br>		Lets you select a file to open from a dialog box.

<li><b>Save As...</b>
<br>		Creates a file whose content is the content area of the
current
Netscape page. A dialog box lets you select the file's format.

<li><b>Save Next Link As...</b> (This feature is implemented on Windows

by holding down the shift key and clicking.)
<br>		Saves to disk (instead of bringing to screen) the page 
whose link you next click on. After you click, the command is canceled.

<li><b>Mail Document...</b>

Document
dialog
box</a> that lets you send a
mail message and page attachment to an e-mail address you
specify.

<li><b>Print Setup...</b> (Not on Windows; On Macintosh: <b>Page
Setup...</b>)
<br>		Produces a dialog box that lets you specify printing
characteristics associated with the current page.

<li><b>Print...</b> (Not on Windows)
<br>		Prints the content area of the current Netscape page. A
dialog box
lets you select printing characteristics. In addition to <b>Print</b>,
the Windows
platform offers a <b>Print Preview</b> menu item to display the layout
of a
printed page.

The dialog box produced by choosing <b>Mail Document</b> in the
<b>File</b> menu offers the following information and options:
<ul>
<li>	The dialog box has text fields for the <b>From:</b> address,
the
<b>To:</b> address, the <b>Subject:</b>, and the body of the message.

MIME
attachment: <b>No attachment</b>, <b>Text, Formatted Text</b>, or
<b>HTML</b>.
<li>	Pressing the <b>Send</b> button distributes the mail into the
network
and closes the dialog box.

<ul>
<li><b>Undo</b>
<br>		Reverses the last action you performed, if possible.

<li><b>Cut...</b>
<br>		Removes the current selection and places a copy on the
clipboard.

<li><b>Copy</b>
<br>		Places a copy of the current selection on the clipboard.

<li><b>Paste</b>
<br>		Puts the contents of the clipboard into the current Netscape
page at
the position of the selection marker.

<li><b>Clear</b> (Macintosh only)
<br>		Removes the current selection.

<li><b>Select All</b> (Macintosh only)
<br> 	Creates a selection composed of the entire contents of the
area
occupied
by the selection marker.

<li><b>Find...</b>
<br>		Produces a <b>Find</b> dialog box that lets you specify a
word or
phrase to locate within the current Netscape page. Pressing the
<b>Find</b>
button begins the search. If a match is found, the text is selected
and, if
necessary, scrolled to a visible position in the content area. If the
<b>Case
Sensitive</b> option is checked, a match can only occur when the use of
uppercase and lowercase letters is the same; otherwise a match can
occur
regardless of case. If the <b>Find Backwards</b> option is checked, the
search
proceeds from the selection bar toward the beginning of the page;
otherwise a
search proceeds from the selection bar toward the end of the page. If a
search
reaches the end or beginning of a page (depending on the direction of
the
search), a dialog box asks whether or not to continue the search to the
beginning or end of the document.

<li><b>Find Again</b> (Not on Windows)
<br>		Searches for another occurrence of the text specified after
using
<b>Find</b>.

<ul>
<li><b>Reload</b>
<br>		Brings a fresh copy of the current Netscape page to replace
the one
originally loaded. The reloaded page displays changes made to the
source
page from the time of the original loading.

<li><b>Load Images</b>
<br>		Displays the images of the current Netscape page. Typically, 
images automatically load into pages. However, if <b>Auto Load
Images</b> from 
the <b>Options</b> menu is unchecked when a page loads, a small icon is

substituted at the position of each image. Choosing <b>Load Images</b>
replaces 
all of the small icons with their corresponding images. Images are
loaded from their 
source files, however the page is not reloaded (links to images are 
not updated from the source page).

<li><b>Refresh</b> (Not on Macintosh)
<br>		Brings a fresh copy of the current Netscape page from local
memory
to
replace the one originally loaded. The refreshed page does not display
changes
made to the source page from the time of the original loading.

<li><b>Source...</b>
<br>		Produces a <b>View Source</b> dialog box containing a page
in the
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) format rather than the standard
format. The
HTML format represents the source document used to create the content
and
content style of a page. The source document is read-only, though the
data can
be selected and copied to an application with editing capabilities. The
current
document title, URL, and HTML source listing are shown in their
respective text
fields. You can view the source listing of only one page at a time. The
<b>Save...</b> button produces a dialog box identical to that of the
<b>Save
As...</b> item from the <b>File</b> menu for saving the source listing
as a
file. You can specify an alternative application to view source (by
selecting a
<b>Preference</b> submenu item in the <b>Options</b> menu) that
produces a
viewer other than this dialog box (the default viewer).

<ul>
<li><b>Back</b>
<br> Brings the previous page in the history list. A history list is 
a reference to a hierarchy of pages you have viewed.

<li><b>Forward</b>
<br> Brings the next page in the history list. If you have used
<b>Back</b> 
or a history menu item to bring back page B, then <b>Forward</b> brings
the 
page ahead of B in the history list. The <b>Forward</b> command is only

offered after using <b>Back</b> or a history item.

<li><b>Home</b>
<br>		Brings the Netscape home page to the screen.

<li><b>Stop Loading</b>
<br>   Halts the connection in progress that is bringing a page to the
screen.

<li><b>View History....</b>
<br>		Produces a <b>History</b> dialog box that lists, in two
columns,
the title and URL of each page you have seen as you "most recently"
descended
from the home page. (For example, if you go from page Animal to page
Cat to
page Calico, then back to page Animal and traverse the path Animal to
Dog to
Spaniel, your history maintains only the most recent Animal-Dog-Spaniel
lineage.) The history list is sorted with the most recently viewed
pages at the
top. One item in the list is always selected. Pressing the <b>Go to</b>
button
brings the selected page back to the screen. So does double-clicking on
an
item. Pressing the <b>Add to Bookmark</b> button puts the selected page
into
the bookmark list (in the same way the <b>Add Bookmark</b> item works
in the
<b>Bookmarks</b> menu).

<li><b><i>History item 1</i></b>
<br>		Brings the first page in the history list (each menu item
is a title of a page).

<li><b><i>History item 2</i></b>
<br>		Brings the second page in the history list (and so on, each
menu item is a title of a page).

The <b>Bookmarks</b> menu provides fast and easy access to your
favorite pages. Initially, the menu displays only the two items that
help you
add and modify pages in a bookmark list. However, as you add a page to
a
bookmark list, the title of the page (or any other name you wish to
supply as a
bookmark title) is appended as a menu item. Selecting the title from
the
<b>Bookmarks</b> menu brings the page to your screen.
<p>
Bookmarks are maintained in lists, each list is represented by a
bookmarks
file. You can maintain multiple bookmark lists, each with its own set
of titles
linked to favorite pages, though only one bookmark list can be active
at a
time. The menu item <b>View Bookmarks...</b> produces a
<b>Bookmark List</b> dialog
box offering options that allow you to build and maintain one or more
bookmark
files. Any changes you make to the active bookmark list (the one
currently
available through the <b>Bookmark List</b> dialog box) are saved and
available the
next time you start the Netscape application.
<p>
You can organize and customize items in the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu
through the
<b>Bookmark List</b> dialog box. Bookmark menu items can be arranged
hierarchically. The dialog box permits you to create a hierarchy by
defining
header items in the list, then inserting bookmark items indented (in
outline
form) below each header. The <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> buttons (arrows on the 
Macintosh) control the line position and indention of items. An 
item indented one deep in the bookmark list appears
as a submenu of the header in the menu. An item indented two
deep in
the list appears as a submenu of a submenu, and so on. Each indentation
of an
item in the bookmark list corresponds to the item's hierarchical
sublevel in
the menu. You can also share bookmark lists with other Netscape users by
exchanging bookmark files. Bookmark files are HTML-formatted pages. 
You can create an HTML file using the <b>Export Bookmarks</b> button and 
install an HTML file using the <b>Import Bookmarks</b> button.

<ul>
<li><b>Add Bookmark</b>
<br>		Adds the title of the current Netscape page to the list of
pages in the bookmark file.

<li><b>View Bookmarks...</b>
<br>		Produces a <a href="menus.html#RTFToC7">Bookmark List
dialog box</a>
that allows you to create and modify bookmark files.

<li><b><i>Bookmark item 1</i></b>
<br>		Brings the first page in the bookmarks list (each menu item
is a title of a page).

<li><b><i>Bookmark item 2</i></b>
<br>		Brings the second page in the bookmarks list (and so on,
each menu item is a title of a page).

The <b>Bookmark List</b> dialog box produced by choosing <b>View
Bookmarks...</b> in the
<b>Bookmarks</b> menu offers the following information and options:<p>

<ul>
<li>	A field lists the bookmarks in the active bookmarks file. You
can
select
any one item in the list to view information about the selected
bookmark and to
begin editing the list. 
<li>	Press the <b>Add Bookmark</b> button to insert the current page
title
directly below the current selection in the list. If the current
selection is a
header item, the page title is inserted below and indented to the right
of the
header.
<li>	Press the <b>Go To</b> button to bring the page specified by
the
current
selection in the list. If the current selection is not a page title,
the button
is dimmed.
<li>	Press the <b>View Bookmarks...</b> button to create a new
Netscape
page
containing the list in HTML format. You can save the page using the
<b>Save
As</b> command from the <b>File</b> menu.
<li>	Press the <b>Export Bookmarks</b> button to produce a dialog
box for saving the
active bookmarks file. The file is saved as an HTML-formatted page. 
Enter a file name of your choosing, then press
<b>OK</b> (<b>Save</b> on Macintosh) to create a bookmarks file. You
can
exchange bookmark files
with
other users by using the <b>Export Bookmarks</b> and <b>Import
Bookmarks</b> buttons.
<li>	Press the <b>Import Bookmarks</b> button to produce a dialog
box for inserting
a bookmarks file (an HTML-formatted page) into the active bookmarks 
file. Choose the bookmarks file from
the dialog box, then press <b>OK</b> (<b>Open</b> on Macintosh) to
insert the bookmarks after
the last
bookmark of the active list.
<li>	Select an item from the <b>Menu Adds After</b> pop-up menu to 
specify the head position for new page titles added through the menu
bar. 
Subsequent selections of the <b>Add Bookmark</b> menu item adds the
title at the 
end of the list or after the specified header.
<li>	Select an item from the <b>Menu Start With</b> pop-up menu to
specify 
the head position for displaying items under the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu.
Subsequent 
selections of the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu show the entire list or only
those items in 
the hierarchy of the specified header.
<li>	Press the <b>New Bookmark</b> button to insert a new item
(temporarily
titled <b>New Item</b>) below the current selection in the list. Enter
the
bookmark title that you wish to use in the <b>Name</b> field and the
new item's
URL in the <b>Location</b> field, then click in the list (or press
another
button)
to complete the insertion.
<li>	Press the <b>New Header</b> button to insert a new header below
the
current selection in the list. Enter the name of the new header in the
<b>Name</b> text field, then click in the list (or press another
button) to
complete the insertion.
<li>	Press the <b>New Separator</b> button to insert a divider below
the
current selection in the list. 

<li>	The <b>Name</b> text field contains the name of the current
selection in the list. You can edit the name in the field to supply a
bookmark
title of your choice. Click in the list to complete the edit.
<li>	The <b>Location</b> text field contains the URL of the current
selection
in the list. You can edit the URL in the field. Click in the list to
complete
the edit.
<li>	The <b>Last Visited</b> text shows the date that the current
selection in
the list was last viewed.
<li>	The <b>Added On</b> text shows the date that the current
selection was
added to the list.
<li>	The <b>Description</b> text field contains any text you wish to
supply
about the current URL selection in the list.
<li>	Press the <b>Up</b> button (arrow on Macintosh) to move or
indent
the current
selection
in the
list. Typically, pressing the <b>Up</b> button swaps the positions of
the
current selection and the item directly above the current selection.
However,
the <b>Up</b> button behaves with the following characteristics: if the
current
selection is a header, the header and its sub-items move as a single
item; if
the item directly above the current selection is indented to the right
of the
current selection, pressing the <b>Up</b> button indents the current
selection.
<li>	Press the <b>Down</b> button (arrow on Macintosh) to move the
current selection in
the
list or
reverse the current selection's indentation. Typically, pressing the
<b>Down</b> button swaps the positions of the current selection and the
item
directly below the current selection. However, the <b>Down</b> button
behaves
with the following characteristics: if the current selection is a
header, the
header and its sub-items move as a single item; if the item directly
below the
current selection is positioned to the left of the current selection,
pressing
the <b>Down</b> button moves the current selection one tab stop to the
left
(reverses a single indent).
<li>	Press the <b>Find</b> button to search for items in the
bookmark
list
(both titles and URLs) that matches text you enter in the <b>Find</b>
field.
The search begins at the current selection and searches downward. The
search is
not case sensitive. When a match is found, the item is selected. If the
match
is in a URL, the URL is also selected. Pressing the <b>Find</b> button
again
searches for the next occurrence. If no match is found, the text in the
<b>Find</b> field is selected. If an item is found under a folded
header, the
header's list is automatically unfolded and the found item selected.
<li>	The <b>Edit</b> (<b>More Options</b> on the Macintosh) button
expands the <b>Bookmarks</b>
dialog box
to its full set of options.
<li>	The <b>Done Editing</b> (<b>Fewer Options</b> on the
Macintosh)
button limits the <b>Bookmarks</b>
dialog box
to its minimum set of options.
<li>	The <b>Copy Item</b> button creates a duplicate of the current
selection
and positions the new item directly below the original.
<li>	The <b>Remove Item</b> button deletes the current selection
from
the
list.</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Preferences...</b>
<br>		Presents a pop-up menu for selecting one of several
<b>Preference</b> dialog boxes. Each dialog box lets you configure one
of the
following Netscape feature sets (each documented on their own page):
<a href="menus.html#RTFToC10">Styles</a>; <a href="menus.html#RTFToC11">Directory, Applications, and

<b>Preference</b> dialog has <b>OK</b> and <b>Cancel</b>
buttons.
Click the <b>OK</b> button to close the dialog box while accepting any
changes
in preference settings. Click <b>Cancel</b> to close the dialog box
without
accepting any changes. (Netscape on the UNIX platform offers a

If
unchecked, images are not loaded and are instead represented by small
icons
that can loaded at a later time (by choosing <b>Load Images</b> from
the
<b>View</b> menu or <b>Images</b> from the toolbar). Unchecking this
item
increases the speed
for
bringing the text portion of a page to your screen.

<li><b>Show FTP File Information</b>
<br>Toggles the visibility of file information received in FTP (File
Transport Protocol) format. If checked, the FTP file information is
visible. If
unchecked, alignment of other FTP data may improve.

<li><b>Save Options</b>
<br>Saves any changes made to options so that the changes remain in
effect for subsequent Netscape sessions.

<b>Directories:</b><p>
The Netscape application uses helper applications to access items
formatted in a way that Netscape cannot interpret on its own. Before the
helper
application
executes, Netscape temporarily stores these files onto disk. After the
helper
application is exited, Netscape deletes the files. You might use this
option if,
for example, you're default disk is short on space and you want to
store
temporary files in an alternative location.
<ul>
<li>	Lists the location of the <b>Temporary Directory</b>. Click its
<b>Browse</b> button to select a new default folder to hold the
temporary files
that are saved to disk before use by a helper application.
<li>	(Windows only) Lists the location of the <b>Bookmark File</b>. 
Click its <b>Browse</b> button to select a new default folder to 
hold bookmark lists.

</ul><b>Supporting Applications:</b><p>
You can also specify the folder to store applications that support
Netscape. Whereas helper applications provide a page with multimedia
presentation
capabilities (according to MIME type), supporting applications provide
Netscape
with connection and page formatting utilities.
<ul>
<li>	Lists the location of the <b>Telnet Application</b>. Telnet
provides the
means to connect to and interact with another computer using standard
Internet
protocols. Click its <b>Browse</b> button to identify a new location.
<li>	Lists the location of an application to <b>View Source</b> (if
required
by your platform). The source viewer application displays a page's text
embedded with the HTML formatting commands. Click its <b>Browse</b>
button to
identify a new location.
<li>	Lists the location of the <b>TN3270 Application</b>. TN3270 is
used for
Telnet connections to IBM mainframes. Click its <b>Browse</b> button to
identify a new location.

</ul><b>News:</b><p>
You must specify a news server to interact with Usenet newsgroups. If

The Netscape application brings files to your computer using various
server protocols such as HTTP, NNTP, SMTP, and FTP. Each protocol may
support
different file formats. Netscape has the built-in capability to read
(interpret
and display on your computer) several formats including the HTML format
used by
HTTP servers. When the Netscape application retrieves a file with a
format that
Netscape itself cannot read, the application attempts to use an external
helper
application capable of reading the file. Netscape uses a
<b>Preferences</b>
dialog box to allow you to examine and configure how a file's format
maps to a
helper application. The dialog box contains several fields and buttons
to
specify MIME types (a method of differentiating file formats using a
suffix
appended to a file name), helper applications, and associated
actions.</ul>
<ul>
<li>	A scrolling text field lists the helper applications available
to the
Netscape application. Each line of the text field contains information
about one
helper application. By clicking on a line in the text field, you can
see and
modify preferences for the selected helper application in the area
below the
scrolling field.
<li>	Enter a <b>Mime type</b> in a text field.
<li>	Enter a <b>Subtype</b> in a text field.
<li>	Enter <b>Extensions</b> in a text field.
<li>	Pressing the <b>New...</b> button produces a <b>New</b> dialog
box with
two text fields for you to enter a MIME type and MIME subtype. Clicking
the
<b>Okay</b> button of the <b>New</b> dialog verifies the data and, if
valid,
adds the MIME information to the list.
<li>
<li>	The application name and its file type is listed. Click the
<b>Browse</b> button to select a different application.
<li>	(Macintosh only) Choose the application's default file type
from
the
<b>File
Type</b> pop-up menu.
<li>
<li>	 	Select one of four radio buttons <b>Save</b>, <b>Launch
Application</b>,
<b>Use Netscape as VIewer</b>, or <b>Unknown: Prompt User</b> to
designate the
action performed by the helper application.
<li>	<b>Save</b> produces a dialog box for saving a file to disk
after
the
file is downloaded.
<li>	<b>Launch Application</b> opens the selected application using
the
downloaded file as its document.
<li>	<b>Use Netscape as Viewer </b>opens the downloaded file in
Netscape's
content area.
<li>	<b>Unknown: Prompt User</b> causes a notification to the
user.</ul>
