    If you're trying to find a particular page on the Internet, you can use one of
    the many available online <B>Search Engines</B>.  These search engines allow
    you to search for information in many different ways -- some engines search
    titles or headers of documents on the net, others search the documents
    themselves, still others just search other indexes or directories.<P>
    
    For every case, we'll cite a sample search thet provides some guidence about each engine's effectiveness.<p>
