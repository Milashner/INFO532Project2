Mosaic Communications Corporation offers support agreements for companies and 
organizations who want 
to stay fully informed and avoid the risk of unsupported technology.  
These agreements are an annualized subscription for Netsite
applications and either a help desk annual subscription or time-and-materials 
support for  Netscape applications.  We hope that no
matter what the size of your ambition or the size of your organization
is, you will find a support level that fits your needs. </dl>

Annual support contracts are available for each installed Netsite server 
and are not discountable.  Although we are providing a great amount 
of support information over the Internet,  we will also push more 
technical information, maintenance releases, and selected call histories 
to supported Netsite customers.  In addition, supported customers will 
have direct access to our technical support engineers and will receive 
Netsite updates and documentation as they are released.  Product upgrades 
and training will be available at a discount for supported customers.

Mosaic Communications Corporation offers two support alternatives for
companies  and organizations seeking help with their installed base of
Netscape products.   
<ul>
<a name="helpdesk"></a>
<li><b>Netscape Helpdesk</b><p>
<ul>
Our Helpdesk is an annualized subscription aimed at customers who are
providing formal helpdesk support for employees and clients that have
installed Netscape.
This service works hand-in-hand with Netsite support agreements and
will provide subscribers with information and materials necessary to
be their own support hub, including maintenance releases, electronic
documentation, Netscape updates, notification of work-arounds,
selected call histories, and unlimited access for two authorized
callers to consult with Mosaic Communications Corporation technical
support engineers. This service is best for a Netscape installed
base of 125 or more or for organizations who desire the highest level
of quality for a small installed base. 
<p>
<b>Pricing for Netscape Helpdesk:</b><p>

Helpdesk: 15% of installed base value with a US$5,000 minimum

<p>Please contact Mosaic Communications Corporation Customer Solutions
Center by e-mail, support@mcom.com, for a quotation. 
</ul><p>

<a name="consult"></a>

<li><b>Netscape Consultation</b><p>
 <dl>
<ul>
For customers with less formal internal support or with casual use of 
a small base of Netscape applications, Mosaic Communications
Corporation offers <b>Netscape Consultation</b> - telephone
consultation on a time-and-materials basis.  Calls will be billed to
the caller's credit card and consultation will accrue at a rate of $25
for the first quarter hour and $2 per minute beyond.  This support
becomes very economical for network administrators or individuals
supporting a department-sized group of users who can aggregate support
questions before initiating a support call.
<p>

Please contact Mosaic Communications Corporation Customer Solutions
Center by e-mail, support@mcom.com, to obtain your Consultation contact
number.<p>
