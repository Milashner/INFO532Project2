Netscape is what we in the telecommunications biz call a client. It's
a piece of software that lets you navigate around the Internet in a
graphical way through your network or dial-up connection. Its primary
job is to take the information the Internet gives you about where you
are and what is there and display it on your computer. Netscape does
this by rendering a text file called a HTML, or HyperText Markup
Language, file.<P>  

Netscape provides a complete interface to all parts of the Internet.
It allows you to access all the traditional forms of net-info, like
FTP sites, GOPHER menu trees, and USENET newsgroups.  If you aren't
familiar with these arcane terms, don't worry; it will all be
explained in the next few pages.  Also, you can explore the multimedia
aspect of the Internet by downloading pictures, sound, and compressed
video.  These files are viewed through helpers, accessory programs
bundled with Netscape that launch when needed once the file(s) have
been transferred.<P>
