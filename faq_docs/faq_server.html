<dt><b><a name="s1">What  is Netsite server software?</a></b>
<p>
<dd>Netsite is the first commercial Internet server software that
is compatible with the NCSA httpd server.  Netsite software
allows organizations to "serve" or post information, including formatted 
text, graphical images, audio and video, and to conduct transactions on the
Internet and other global networks based on the Internet Protocol
(IP). 
<p>
The Netsite product line includes two products available for UNIX-based
platforms:
<ul>
<li>Netsite Communications Server
<li>Netsite Commerce Server
</ul><p>
The Netsite Communications Server is designed for applications that 
don't require the advanced  security features contained  in the Netsite Commerce Server, such as the delivery of online marketing materials and customer support 
information to customers, and communications  to employees.
<p>
The Netsite Commerce Server makes electronic commerce a reality allowing transactions and the exchange of sensitive data on the Internet.
The Netsite Commerce Server provides bulletproof  security based on public-key cryptographic technology from RSA Data Security, Inc.
<p>
Bulletproof security includes data encryption to ensure the privacy of client/server communications, and server authentication, which uses certification  and a digital signature to verify the legitimacy of the server.
<p>

<hr align="RIGHT" width="85%">
<dt><b><a name="s2">What  can a Netsite server software do for my business?</a></b>
<p>
<dd>Netsite servers let you reach the more than 3 million users 
of HTTP-compatible network navigators (including Netscape and NCSA Mosaic) who access the Internet;  or, simply communicate
with the people in your branch office. 
<p>
With the Netsite Communication Server you can set up an
interactive,  media-rich environment for applications such as 
marketing, corporate communications, 
and distance learning.
<p>
Using the Netsite Commerce Server, you can close the deal online, accepting both
orders and payments over the Internet.
The Netsite Commerce Server can also handle 
online publishing services and sensitive communications of all kinds.<p>

<!-------------------------------------------------->

<hr align="RIGHT" width="85%">
<dt><b><a name="s3">How is Netsite server software different from
the NCSA httpd server software? </a></b>
<p> 
<dd>Here are some of the features that makes Netsite server software
outstanding: 
<ul>
<li>Increased performance, including lightning fast response 
times and superior handling of peak loads
<li>More efficient use of your hardware and communications infrastructure,
reducing the total cost of operation
<li>Easier installation, configuration and maintenance using intuitive online forms
<li>Bulletproof security, making it possible to conduct commerce and secure communications
using the Netsite Commerce Server
<li>Scalability, to accommodate  varying traffic loads
<li>Extensibility, to incorporate additional features on a modular basis

</ul><p>
Netsite servers are also built and backed by the development
team that conceived and wrote the NCSA httpd server prototype and are 
supported by a professional software support organization.
<p>

<hr align="RIGHT" width="85%">
<dt><b><a name="s3.1">Are Netsite servers compatible with NCSA httpd and NCSA Mosaic?
Do they support industry standard protocols and document formats?</a></b>
<p>
<dd>Netsite servers are backward compatible with all HTTP-based
clients and servers, including NCSA Mosaic and NCSA httpd respectively.  They
utilize  industry standard protocols HTTP and TCP/IP and the HTML document format.
You can serve any hypermedia content you may have already developed.<p>


<!-------------------------------------------------->
<hr align="RIGHT" width="85%">
<dt><b><a name="s3.2">Does Netsite software provide security for online transactions or sensitive communications?
</a></b>
<p>

<dd>The Netsite Commerce Server incorporates bulletproof
security based upon public-key cryptographic  technology  from RSA Data Security, the leader in computer data security.<p>
Bulletproof security includes:
<ul>
<li>Encryption to ensure the privacy of client/server communications 
<li>Server authentication  to verify the identity of the server
</ul>
<p>

The Netsite Communications Server does not have any
security features.<p>
